### Evaluation Board with nice Enclosure, providing plenty diffrent ports

# Introduction

I wanted a universal Node for The Things Network that provides diffrent ports for diffrent Purposes.
Becouse I don´t really like Breadboards I decided to design a little PCB that fits in a suitable enclosure. You can find the EAGLE-Files [here.](https://github.com/jossiTech/TTN-Node-P2/tree/master/Eagle-Files) 

* 1-Wire-Bus
* I2C
* Relais Port
* DHT11 / DHT22 Socket for temperature and humidity
* USB-B-Port for Input voltage
* Socket to connect an FTDI-Module for uploading new sketches
* SMA-Connector for Antenna





The node consist of an Arduino Pro Micro (3.3V) and a RFM95W Radio to communicate with „The Things Network.“ The RFM95W-Radio-Model use 3.3 Volt, so when using the 3.3 Volt Version of the Arduino Pro Micro no level shifting is necessary.
 
You find the suitable enclosure for the PCB by searching for "strabubox 524"
I have ordered a few PCBs from [Eurocircuits](https://www.eurocircuits.com/) and a few sets of components of my favorite chinese distributer. If you´re interested in the PCB or the PCB with the components and the enclosure you can find it on [Tindie.](https://www.tindie.com/stores/jossitech/)

[Here](https://github.com/jossiTech/TTN-Node-P2/tree/master/code) you can find the sketch that work fine for the board, feel free to use and modify it for your needs.

I descirbed HERE (add LINK) a straightforward way to visualize 4 temperatures and the humidity on Cayenne.






- The 328P comes with a Arduino Bootloader xyz
- Choose Arduino Nano 328P in the IDE when uploading new sketches
