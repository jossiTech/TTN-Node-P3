example sketch, TTN-credentials hard-coded in the sketch.


# JT-P3-EE.ino

This is a new generic sketch. The TTN credentials are stored in EEPROM. If you start the Node, you can configure DevEUI, AppEUI and Appkey over an FTDI-Adapter with a serial terminal, e.g. the Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE.
